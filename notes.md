Good commit practices :-

```
    feat -> feature
    fix -> bug fix
    docs -> documentation
    style -> formatting, lint stuff
    refactor -> code restructure without changing external behavior
    test -> adding missing tests
    chore -> maintenance
    init -> initial commit
    rearrange -> files moved, added, deleted etc
    update -> update code (versions, library compatibility)
```
